# Three.js Game Development with AI-Assisted Coding

Welcome to the DaVinci School Three.js Game Repository! This project is designed as a collaborative space for building web-based games using three.js with the assistance of GitHub Copilot and other AI coding tools.

## 🎮 About This Project

This repository serves as a **trial and error playground** for "vibe coding" - an experimental approach to development where you collaborate with AI agents to build interactive 3D games. The goal is to explore how GitHub Copilot and AI assistance can enhance the creative coding process.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- A modern web browser
- GitHub Copilot (optional but recommended)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd experience-primer-copilot-davinci-school
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173` (or the URL shown in your terminal)

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

The built files will be in the `dist/` directory.

## 🎨 Current Features

The starter template includes:
- ✅ Basic three.js scene setup
- ✅ A colorful rotating cube
- ✅ Keyboard controls (W/A/S/D to rotate)
- ✅ Mouse movement for camera control
- ✅ Responsive design
- ✅ Vite for fast development and building

## 🤖 Working with AI Agents (Vibe Coding)

This repository is designed for **AI-assisted development**. Here's how to make the most of it:

### Using GitHub Copilot

1. **Enable Copilot**: Make sure GitHub Copilot is installed and enabled in your VS Code or preferred editor

2. **Descriptive Comments**: Write comments describing what you want to build, and let Copilot suggest the implementation:
   ```javascript
   // Create a spinning pyramid with rainbow colors
   // [Let Copilot suggest the code]
   ```

3. **Iterative Development**: Start with simple features and gradually build complexity:
   - Begin with basic shapes
   - Add interactivity
   - Implement game mechanics
   - Polish with animations and effects

### AI Collaboration Best Practices

1. **Clear Intent**: Write clear, descriptive comments about what you're trying to achieve
2. **Small Steps**: Break down complex features into smaller, manageable tasks
3. **Experiment Freely**: This is a trial-and-error space - try different approaches!
4. **Document Learnings**: Add comments about what worked and what didn't
5. **Commit Often**: Make small, frequent commits to track your progress

### Example AI Prompts

Try asking Copilot to help with:
- "Add collision detection between objects"
- "Create a particle system for explosions"
- "Implement a scoring system"
- "Add sound effects when the cube is rotated"
- "Create a skybox with a space theme"

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **[Three.js](https://threejs.org/)**: 3D graphics library for WebGL
- **[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)**: Fast build tool and development server
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Modern JavaScript features
- **HTML5 & CSS3**: Web standards

## 🎯 Game Development Ideas

Here are some ideas to expand this project with AI assistance:

### Beginner Level
- [ ] Add more shapes (spheres, pyramids, cylinders)
- [ ] Change colors based on user interaction
- [ ] Add background music or sound effects
- [ ] Create a simple UI with score display

### Intermediate Level
- [ ] Implement basic physics (gravity, collisions)
- [ ] Add player controls for a character
- [ ] Create collectible objects
- [ ] Implement different game states (menu, playing, game over)

### Advanced Level
- [ ] Build a complete game (e.g., maze runner, space shooter)
- [ ] Add multiplayer functionality
- [ ] Implement advanced shaders and effects
- [ ] Create procedurally generated levels
