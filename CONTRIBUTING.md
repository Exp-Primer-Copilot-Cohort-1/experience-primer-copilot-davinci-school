# Contributing to Three.js Game Development

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this AI-assisted game development project! This guide will help you get started with contributing using GitHub Copilot and other AI tools.

## 🤖 AI-Assisted Development Workflow

This project embraces AI-assisted coding as a core part of the development process. Here's how to contribute effectively:

### 1. Setup Your AI Tools

Before contributing, ensure you have:
- GitHub Copilot enabled in your IDE
- VS Code or your preferred editor configured
- Copilot Chat (if available) for more interactive assistance

### 2. Finding What to Work On

Check the following for ideas:
- Open issues labeled `good-first-issue` or `ai-friendly`
- The "Game Development Ideas" section in GAME_README.md
- Your own creative ideas!

### 3. AI-Assisted Coding Process

#### Step 1: Plan with Comments
Start by writing detailed comments describing what you want to build:

```javascript
// TODO: Create a player class that can move in 3D space
// The player should:
// - Be represented by a sphere
// - Move using arrow keys
// - Have collision detection
// - Have a health system
```

#### Step 2: Let AI Suggest Implementation
Place your cursor below the comments and let Copilot suggest the implementation. Review and modify as needed.

#### Step 3: Iterate and Refine
- Test the suggested code
- Make adjustments based on what works
- Document any challenges or insights

### 4. Code Quality Guidelines

Even when using AI assistance:
- ✅ Review all AI-generated code before committing
- ✅ Ensure code is readable and well-commented
- ✅ Test your changes in the browser
- ✅ Follow the existing code style
- ✅ Remove console.logs before final commit (unless needed for debugging)

### 5. Commit Message Format

Use descriptive commit messages that indicate AI assistance:

```
feat: Add player movement system (AI-assisted)
fix: Correct collision detection bug
docs: Update game development guide
refactor: Improve rendering performance (with Copilot)
```

## 📋 Pull Request Process

1. **Fork** the repository
2. **Create a branch** for your feature: `git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`
3. **Make your changes** using AI assistance
4. **Test thoroughly** in the browser
5. **Commit your changes**: `git commit -m 'feat: Add amazing feature'`
6. **Push to your fork**: `git push origin feature/amazing-feature`
7. **Open a Pull Request** with:
   - Clear description of what you built
   - Notes on AI tools used
   - Any challenges you encountered
   - Screenshots/GIFs if visual changes

## 🎯 AI Prompting Tips

### For GitHub Copilot

**Good Prompts:**
```javascript
// Create a function to generate random obstacles in 3D space
// Each obstacle should be a different color and size
// Position them randomly within bounds -10 to 10 on x and z axes
```

**Less Effective:**
```javascript
// Make obstacles
```

### For Copilot Chat

Ask specific questions:
- "How can I add physics to this cube?"
- "What's the best way to implement collision detection in three.js?"
- "Can you help me refactor this code to be more efficient?"

## 🧪 Experimentation Guidelines

This is a learning repository, so experimentation is encouraged!

### Do:
- ✅ Try unconventional approaches
- ✅ Document what you learn
- ✅ Share interesting AI interactions
- ✅ Ask questions in issues or discussions

### Don't:
- ❌ Commit untested code
- ❌ Break existing functionality without discussion
- ❌ Add large dependencies without justification
- ❌ Ignore errors or warnings

## 📝 Documentation

When adding features:
1. Update GAME_README.md if adding major features
2. Add inline comments explaining complex logic
3. Document any AI prompts that were particularly effective
4. Note any limitations or known issues

## 🐛 Bug Reports

If you find a bug:
1. Check if it's already reported in Issues
2. Create a new issue with:
   - Clear title and description
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Expected vs actual behavior
   - Browser and environment details
   - Screenshots if applicable

## 💡 Feature Requests

For new feature ideas:
1. Check existing issues and discussions
2. Open an issue describing:
   - The feature you'd like to see
   - Why it would be valuable
   - How AI tools might help implement it
   - Any initial thoughts on implementation
