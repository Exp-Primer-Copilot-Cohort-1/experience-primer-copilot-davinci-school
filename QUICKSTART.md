# 🎮 Quick Start Guide

Welcome to your Three.js Game Development Repository!

## What is this?

This is a **trial-and-error playground** for building web-based games with three.js and GitHub Copilot. It's designed to help you explore "vibe coding" - collaborating with AI to create interactive 3D experiences.

## 🚀 Get Started in 3 Steps

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Start Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 3. Open Browser
Navigate to `http://localhost:5173`

You should see a colorful rotating cube! 🎨

## 🎯 What Can You Do?

- **Use W/A/S/D** - Rotate the cube manually
- **Move Mouse** - Control camera position
- **Just Watch** - Cube auto-rotates when idle

## 📖 Next Steps

1. **Read GAME_README.md** - Complete guide to the project
2. **Check CONTRIBUTING.md** - Learn AI-assisted development workflow
3. **Start Coding!** - Use GitHub Copilot to add features

## 💡 First Experiments

Try asking Copilot to help you:
- Add a new shape (sphere, pyramid, etc.)
- Change colors based on keyboard input
- Add particle effects
- Create a simple scoring system

## 🤖 AI Collaboration Tips

1. Write clear comments describing what you want
2. Let Copilot suggest implementations
3. Test and iterate
4. Document what works!
